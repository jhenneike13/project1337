A shitty way to learn python and other junk

Grocery/Pantry/Supplies inventory integrating arduino, python, and data analysis

Arduino interface with LED display for adding item, taking in/out, checking quantity/inventory

Stamps with time/item/user/etc. to be sent to file for analysis such as: how often are we using an item. How fast does this run out. What time of day am I eating. What does my usage look like over the past month, etc.
